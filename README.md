## About me:



Personal projects in data analysis

My name is Alberto Jimenez and I am an Industrial Electronics Specialist (E.T.P.CLot) with a Master in Business Intelligence and Data Science (IEBS). I work every day to be a good data scientist and help with my knowledge to make 'data driven' decisions.

In this repository are my projects related to data science.
